**Interim report feedback session - 18/12/2024**
-

Overall was decently formatted report. Needs a lot of work on the tasks, interaction sections on the report, and generally the tool needs to have more complex visualizations. Can generally improve report and it is advised to by following the feedback provided. 
(Any extra thoughts/comments from me are written in parentheses.)

**Feedback for Introduction:**
- Saying "statistics" in introduction is quite general and does not justify a visualization
- Have to explain why people would want to learn about these shark attacks
- Why is creating a visualization tool important? Why not an automated method to present the target with the data?
- Maybe do some research on why the consumer would actually care about seeing this data
- Final report can have a longer introduction, but don't make it as long as a page or something

**Feedback for Data:**
- Explain about the data set (ASID) more, like what sorts of attributes it has, what does the data actually look like, etc.
- Give more details on preprocessing (and probably also do more preprocessing)
- "For our goal, we chose *x* amount of attributes, to do... because..."
- Maybe can also make new attributes based on information already from the attributes in the data set if it will contribute to the goal
- There were some problems with data abstraction, see feedback (apparently)

**Feedback for Tasks:**
- The tasks defined can be more linked to the actual data attributes, so more can be said about these
- Must have sub-tasks after talking about the main task, nested tasks (so, we can have Task 3.1, and then sub-tasks 3.1(a), 3.1(b). This is also where we can talk more about the data attributes to get points for that)
- Basically have higher level (more vague) and lower level (more specific) tasks
- Task abstraction section was completely missing
- In the task abstraction, have: actions and targets (from the theory, see lectures online, module 1), short paragraph that links the 4 tasks to their abstract terminology, make mapping between tasks and their abstraction
- Can use relations between visualization designs in tasks a little

**Feedback for Current Solution and Interaction:**
- Instead of GUI, focus on the tools that can be used ON the visualization itself for the interaction idioms, of course, you can always talk about the GUI drop-downs and menus but the main focus is on the visualizations
- For example, highlighting in one view of the visualization highlights the reflection of that view on the second visualization
- Parallel coordinates and scatterplot matrices are complex visualizations that can be used for the goal, they actually have to link to the goal so do not blindly use a complex viualization simply because it is complex
- Also not neccessary to have a lot of buttons and things on the tool as it could get confusing for the user
